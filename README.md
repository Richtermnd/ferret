My interpreter for my language (it will be functional or something)

Main idea - create a easy language for doing math, with scalars/vectors/matrix support.

### Roadmap
1. Create a simple calculator
2. Add opportunity for declaring vars
3. logic operands
4. functions
5. vectors
6. matrix
7. ?


### TODO:
 - [x] Scientific notation
 - [ ] Different bases for numbers
 - [x] Check invalid numbers (like 12a3)
 - [ ] Program that goes through all the files and save all todo comments in TODO.md
 - [ ] Compile it in wasm to create interactive web version



### Implementation Q&A
- "Why python like Add/Radd methods for objects?"
- Operators overloading is obviously bad, but not for math.
